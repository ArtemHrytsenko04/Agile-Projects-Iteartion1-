## This README file for our e-commerce website development using Agile Methodology! Here's what we've accomplished:

- **Documented weekly meeting**. We captured the key details of our meeting using the meeting template. This includes agenda, attendees, action items, and further steps.
- **Created Stkeholder register**. We have identified the key stakeholders involved in the development of the E-Commerce website.
- **Developed User Personas**. We created detailed fiction users profiles (personas), who represents our ideal customers.
- **Documented Personas**. We discussed and analyzed the personas profiles and their relevance to our product and how they will interact with our website.  

**Below** you'll find the table of content and links to all the files we were working on.
